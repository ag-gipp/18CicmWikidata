# Representing Mathematical Formulae in Content MathML using Wikidata

We represent mathematical formulae in Content MathML referring to Wikidata as the knowledge base for the grounding of the semantics.
By doing so, we link items in the Wikidata knowledge base to mathematical identifiers or operators.
In contrast to other mathematical knowledge bases which define symbols in a deductive fashion, the terms in Wikidata emerged inductively from Wikipedia articles in different languages.
To maximize the interoperability with non-strict content MathML, we create a Wikidata based content dictionary group.
